The biodigester, also known as ‘Chester the Digester’ now has the capability to manage organic waste at Sydney University for the first time and can transform food products into compost to be reused on campus. (coffee grounds, teabags, food waste and street sweepings)

On the 16th of March, 2022, the Organic Waste Biodigester was launched by NSW Environment and Heritage Minister James Griffin - he stresses the importance of this machine as if it diverts 1 tonne of landfill to food waste, it can save 1 and a half tonnes of carbon dioxide. The biodigester has the ability to transform up to 500kg daily and can operate 24/7 with Central Operations Open Spaces Team who will transport such organic waste offsite to be actioned.

“The NSW Government contributed more than $375,000 towards Chester the Digester through our Waste Less, Recycle More program to help reduce landfill and turn waste into a useful resource,” Mr Griffin said.
