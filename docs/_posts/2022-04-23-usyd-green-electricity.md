The University of Sydney has officially signed a five-year contract with Red Energy (backed by Snowy Hydro) with aims to power 100% of its electricity within NSW from renewable resources by 1 July 2022. This positive impact to move towards sustainability will be equivalent to removing 31,200 cars from the road as well as getting closer to USYD’s goal of zero net emissions by 2030.

“Reducing emissions to combat climate change is a priority for our staff and students and we are committed to embedding sustainability in every aspect of University life.” - Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Mark Scott.

100% renewable electricity will be used in multiple locations around the university, including University-run student accommodation and across all campuses as well as providing energy supply for Moore College, Sancta Sophia College, St Andrew’s College, St Paul’s Collegte, the Woman’s College and Wesley College.
