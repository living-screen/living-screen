# GELION BENCH
The Gelion Bench uses revolutionary zinc-bromide batteries to deliver solar-powered benches at The University of Sydney. Batteries by Endure are used to power off-grid smart benches to optimise stationary energy storage - not only is this smart bench ready-to-use on campus but could power grid applications in the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential industries.

“To power a low-carbon society, we need cheap, safe and ubiquitous batteries for a renewables revolution,” Professor Maschmeyer, a Eureka Prize winner for leadership in innovation and science.

With the batteries being manufactured in Australia, it contributes to powering a renewable Australian economy as well as staying on track with USYD’s sustainability strategy. The revolutionary importance of these Endure batteries are seen in its ability to store energy in a safe, robust, cost-effective and recyclable way to give back to our ecosystem.
