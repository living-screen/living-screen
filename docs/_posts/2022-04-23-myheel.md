Made from mushroom spores, MyHeel is a Grow-It-Yourself Kit that allows users to grow their own smart insoles at home. It contains electronic microprocessors to monitor foot health and encourage sensory awareness - it can also be used with a personalised web application to monitor foot health. The app includes foot exercises that help users prevent any early signs of degrading foot problems.

MyHeel uses Mycelium (vegetative part of a fungus) which is a rapidly growing product with the ability to biodegrade at the end of its use. This project was led by Dr Phil Gough who can see the potential of this invention being commercially successful, “The MyHeel project can take cardboard or sawdust, use a mushroom to grow a new insole, with reusable electronics inside, and the mushroom can be composted when the product ends its use.”
