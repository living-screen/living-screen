The evolution of technology has changed the way public displays look and are used and it has diversified how we can create meaningful and engaging experiences for people in the public. As a result, we also need to be mindful of the impact technology can have on the environment and ensure we arenâ€™t only thinking of its short-term benefits (public engagement) but also the long term effects. That is, pollution of our public spaces such as e-waste. Furthermore, living in an environmentally-conscious modern world, designers and scientists are joining forces to use living media interfaces as they are a great sustainable alternative. 

We can see public displays in a range of places

# Our Project Goal 
There are too many detrimental effects to the environment when using technological public displays. The goal of this project focuses on how we can promote the use of living media interfaces to USYD students in the Wilkinson Building as a sustainable alternative to digital public displays. As a result, we aim to utilise this project to study user behaviour whilst promoting sustainable technology.
